        <span>LAW OF INERTIA</span>
      </div>
      <p class="body">Have you ever wondered why, when you're on a Viking ride at an amusement park and it swings to its highest point, you feel a sensation of weightlessness as it briefly pauses before plunging down? Or why, when it reaches the bottom of its swing, you feel pressed firmly into your seat? The answer to these questions lies in a fundamental concept in physics called inertia.</p><br>
      <p class="body">Inertia is not a force, but rather a property of matter that describes its inherent resistance to changes in its state of motion. Every object with mass possesses inertia.</p><br>
      <p class="subheading">LAW OF INERTIA</p>
      <p class="body"><span class="bold">Inertia</span> is <span class="highlight">the tendency of a body to stay at rest when it is initially at rest or stay in uniform motion in a straight line when initially in motion unless acted upon by an external force.</span></p><br>
      <p class="body">The concept of inertia was formally described by Sir Isaac Newton in his First Law of Motion, often referred to as the <span class="highlight">Law Of Inertia</span></p><br>
      <p class="body">In Law Of Inertia it states that: <span class="bold">An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force.</span></p>
      <p class="subheading">Lets Breakdown the statement</p>
      <p class="body">1. <span class="bold">Objects at rest stay at rest:</span> If something isn't moving, it won't start moving unless a force pushes or pulls it. Imagine a book on a table; it stays put until something makes it move.</p><br>
      <p class="body">2. <span class="bold">Objects in motion stay in motion:</span> If something is already moving, it'll keep moving at the same speed and in the same direction forever, unless a force acts on it. On Earth, forces like friction and air resistance usually slow things down, but in the vacuum of space, an object would keep going indefinitely.</p><br>
      <p class="body">3. <span class="bold">Changes require an unbalanced force:</span> For an object's motion to change—to start moving, stop, speed up, slow down, or change direction—there must be a "net" or "unbalanced" force acting on it. If all forces are balanced, the object's motion won't change; it will either remain still or continue moving steadily.</p>
      <p class="heading">Mass: The Measure of Inertia</p>
      <p class="body">Mass is the <span class="highlight">measure of the amount of matter in an object.</span></p><br>
      <p class="body">The amount of inertia an object possesses is directly proportional to its mass.</p><br>
      <p class="body">1. <span class="bold">More Mass = More Inertia:</span> An object with a greater mass will have greater inertia. This means it will be harder to get it moving if it's at rest, and harder to stop it or change its direction if it's already moving.</p><br>
      <p class="body">2. <span class="bold">Less Mass = Less Inertia:</span> Conversely, an object with less mass will have less inertia. It will be easier to change its state of motion.</p><br>
      <p class="body"><span class="bold">Example:</span> It takes much more force to push a large truck from a standstill than it does to push a bicycle. This is because the truck has significantly more mass, and therefore more inertia, resisting the change from rest to motion. Similarly, once the truck is moving, it's much harder to stop than the bicycle.</p>
      <p class="heading">Everyday Examples of Inertia</p>
      <p class="body">1. <span class="bold">Seatbelts in Cars:</span> When a car suddenly stops, your body tends to continue moving forward due to its inertia. A seatbelt applies a force to stop your body, preventing you from hitting the dashboard or windshield.</p><br>
      <p class="body">2. <span class="bold">Riding a Bicycle:</span> When you pedal a bicycle, you apply a force to get it moving. Once it's moving, if you stop pedaling, it continues to roll due to inertia until friction and air resistance eventually bring it to a stop.</p><br>
      <p class="body">3. <span class="bold">Shaking a Ketchup Bottle:</span> To get ketchup out of a bottle, you often shake it downward and then quickly stop. The ketchup, due to its inertia, tends to continue moving downward even after the bottle stops, forcing it out.</p><br>
      <p class="body">4. <span class="bold">Pulling a Tablecloth Trick:</span> Magicians can pull a tablecloth quickly from under a set of dishes without disturbing them. The dishes, due to their inertia, tend to remain in their original state of rest. If the pull is quick enough and friction minimal, the force isn't applied long enough to overcome their inertia significantly.</p><br>
      <p class="body">5. <span class="bold">Running and Stopping:</span> A sprinter cannot stop instantly after crossing the finish line. Their body has inertia and wants to continue moving forward, requiring a force (from their muscles and friction with the ground) to slow down.</p>

            1. A coin <br>
            2. An index card or playing card <br>

            1. Place the card flat on top of the glass. <br>

          <p class="body">The card flies away, but the coin drops into the glass due to inertia—it wants to stay at rest.</p>
